Traditional international wire-transfers are also accepted, but this has to
be arranged. Please contact project maintainer(s) for details:

If you donate, feel free to email and request a feature, a bug fix or anything
else related. I can't guarantee it, but since I've been working on this software
and using it myself for over a year I do think there must be people like myself
out there, who would find this tool immensely helpful. It's not going to
suddenly stop working - especially because it's just Bash scripts. So every
feature or bugfix added stays there and will, in most likelihood, keep working
without a glitch - for years to come - and without much need for maintenance.
