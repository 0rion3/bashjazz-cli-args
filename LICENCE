THINGS NOT CONCERNING LICENSING
-------------------------------
When forking, PLEASE CONSIDER leaving the "donation message" which is
displayed to when a test-script is run.

When the donation message starts to annoy you - by all means, disable it:
all you have to do is add DISABLE_BASHJAZZ_DONATION_MESSAGE=1 into your shell
environment file.


FORKING
-------
If you decide to fork the repository and publish it some place else, it would
be of great help if you kept the message, the original links the maintainer's
website and donation information without modifications. Your help in this regard
- not removing the donation info - would be greatly appreciated.

See the official website donation page at https://bashjazz.orion3.space/donate
for details.
